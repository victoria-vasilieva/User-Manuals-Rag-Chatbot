Put the robot on the charging dock and charge it before use.\n • The battery temperature is too low or too high. Only use the robot within the range of 4-40°C (39-104°F).\nUnable to charge      • Check the power indicator light turns on and both ends of the power cabel are properly connected.\n • If contact is poor, clean the contact areas on the charging dock and the robot.  \nSlow charging    • When used at high or low temperatures, the robot will automatically reduce its charging speed to extend battery life.\n • The charging contacts may be dirty. Wipe them with a dry cloth.\nUnable to dock    • There are too many obstacles near the charging dock. Move it to an open area.\n • The robot is too far from the charging dock. Place it closer and retry.\nAbnormal behavior  • Restart the robot.\nNoise during cleaning    • The main brush, side brush, main wheels, or omni-directional wheel may be jammed. Turn off the robot and clean them. \n • VibraRise system abnormal. Check for jammed objects.\nUnable to connect to WiFi   \n • WiFi is disabled.
